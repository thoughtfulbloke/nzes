# nzes
R code for the New Zealand Election Study (see http://www.nzes.org for the study site (I am in no way affiliated, this is just using things as public data))

* makeCsvNZES2011.R

This is some code for converting the Election survey results file in SPSS to a csv spreadsheet file. As there are values labels, but not values labels for every value, it needs a little massaging beyond the simple commands.

* liking.R

Code I used for calculating how much voters liked the party they were voting for, and how much the liked other political parties.
